        <p style="font-size: 22px; color: #333; font-weight: 500;">Imagine you're on a train moving very fast! </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6;">
            If you throw a ball inside the train, for you, it moves normally. But for someone outside watching the train, the ball moves with the speed of the train **plus** the speed of your throw. This is called relativity!  
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6;">
            Einstein figured out that space and time are connected. This means time moves differently depending on how fast you're going! If you move close to the speed of light, time **slows down** for you compared to someone standing still. This is called **Time Dilation**.  
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6;">
            Imagine you and your twin are 20 years old. One of you goes on a spaceship that flies near the speed of light, while the other stays on Earth. If the space traveler comes back after 10 years (as per their clock), they might find their twin much older! This happens because time passed slower for the traveler.  
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6;">
            Another cool thing is that when something moves very fast, it gets heavier. This is because energy and mass are related. That’s why Einstein’s famous equation **E = mc²** means energy and mass are connected.

        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6;">
            Einstein’s ideas changed how we understand space, time, and gravity. He also discovered that big objects, like the Sun, bend space around them, affecting how things move. This explains why planets orbit the Sun!

        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #555; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6;">
            Without Einstein’s theory, we wouldn’t have things like **GPS**! Since satellites move fast in space, time moves differently for them compared to us on Earth. Scientists use relativity to make GPS signals work correctly!  
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 22px; color: #333; font-weight: 600;">Einstein was a genius! His ideas help us understand the universe better. </p>
